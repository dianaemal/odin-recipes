        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, 
        but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans.
         A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together.
          This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl
             until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a 
            lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into
             desired pasta shape.</li>
